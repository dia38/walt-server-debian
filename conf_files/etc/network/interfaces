# walt normally requires 2 interfaces:
# * an interface for internet connection
# * an interface for connecting walt experimentation network

# If the host has two physical interfaces, the configuration
# can be obvious.
# If it has only one interface, one can configure VLANs
# in file /etc/walt/server.conf in order to use this
# single interface for both networks.

# Here, since this initial setup might be used for quick
# demo purposes, we just require the host to have one
# interface with internet connection (this is eth0).
# The walt network (walt-net virtual bridge) will be
# connected to a fake secondary interface called "walt-dummy".
# If, in your case, the host really has a second physical
# interface (eth1), you can simply remove this declaration of
# "walt-dummy" below, and replace "walt-dummy" by "eth1" in
# file /etc/walt/server.conf.
